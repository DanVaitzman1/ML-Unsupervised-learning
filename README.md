# Unsupervised-learning

This repository contains the code and documentation for implementing K-means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using unsupervised learning techniques.

## Overview

The exercise is divided into several sections, each focusing on a different aspect of unsupervised learning:

1. **Data Visualization**: We start by visualizing the customer segmentation dataset using various plots to uncover patterns and trends in the data.

2. **K-means Clustering**: Next, we apply K-means clustering to identify distinct customer segments. We scale the data, encode categorical variables, and apply K-means on selected features. Additionally, we find the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method and Silhouette score.

3. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: We implement PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the data. We visualize the principal components and calculate the variance explained by each component.

4. **PCA & K-means Integration**: Finally, we integrate PCA with K-means clustering to identify clusters using the principal components. We again find the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method and Silhouette score.

5. **Manual K-means Clustering**: As a bonus exercise, we manually perform K-means clustering on a set of two-dimensional points.

## Instructions

To run the code in the Jupyter Notebook, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries listed in the notebook using pip or conda.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook in your preferred environment (JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook, etc.).
4. Execute each code cell in the notebook sequentially to observe the results.

Feel free to explore, modify, and extend the code as needed for your learning and experimentation.
